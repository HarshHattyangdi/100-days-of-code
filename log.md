# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: December 25, 2021

### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Started with the journey, solved the valid paranthesis probelm on leetcode (problem no.20). Also learnt a bit about forking and working with Git. Revised bootstrap and jQuery.

**Thoughts:** Really struggled with the basic logic of using stacks in javascript but managed to get a solution with time and space complexity of O(n). Feels good to when leetcode accepts your solution. Adjusted the document according to the linters wishes. Hopefully i do not end up overwriting the original file on kallaways github, cause this will really be my first ever contribution in an opensource community. Hoping to continue with this challenge. Also went through jQuery and Bootstrap and tried to refactor the weather app a bit. And was scared of class based react but going through freecode camps react course is kind of encouraging and probably will understand how react worked initally to get better at using the hooks and functional components. Thinking of refactoring the weather app so that it loads correct data initially.

## Day 1: December 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Solved a leetcode problem involving linkedlist in javascript. Read through the basics of SASS. Refactored the weather-app to make a request once initially, instead of making 2.

**Thoughts:** Struggled with the logic of traversing a linkedList had to use leetcode discussion forum. Hope to do away with the discussion forum and come up with original solution. Read through the basics of SASS and learnt that it could do a lot of cool stuff like conditionally style a page, use loops, nest css. Amazing reading!. Came back to the weatherap project modified it to get some simple constant city data and pretty print the JSON which at first seemed like a task, but turns out that can be done with a simple 'pre' tag followed by setting an identation/space in the JSON>stringify() function.

## Day 2: December 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Solved 3 leetcode problems involving arrays. Problems 26,27,28. Tried to implement a debounce function so that search term is only updated after user stops typing.

**Thoughts:** I can now understand the probelm properly and am able to walk through the logic, just the implementation part seems a bit tough. Came up with an original solution which got accepted at the first run. Feels good when the solution gets accepted without failing any test cases. Doing very easy problems currently, but hey baby steps right?. Also thought of implementing SASS in the app but need to work on the main logic first, a search feature which sends request after user stops typing. Well the search for an optimal solution continues but I think I should stop and call it a day.
