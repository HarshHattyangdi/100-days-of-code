# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 25, 2021

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Started with the journey, solved the valid paranthesis probelm on leetcode (problem no.4). Also learnt a bit about forking and working with Git.

**Thoughts:** Really struggled with the basic logic of using stacks in javascript but managed to get a solution with time and space complexity of O(n). Feels good to when leetcode accepts your solution. Hopefully i do not end up overwriting the original file on kallaways github, cause this will really be my first ever contribution in an opensource community. Hoping to continue with this challenge.
