# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: December 25, 2021

### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Started with the journey, solved the valid paranthesis probelm on leetcode (problem no.20). Also learnt a bit about forking and working with Git. Revised bootstrap and jQuery.

**Thoughts:** Really struggled with the basic logic of using stacks in javascript but managed to get a solution with time and space complexity of O(n). Feels good to when leetcode accepts your solution. Adjusted the document according to the linters wishes. Hopefully i do not end up overwriting the original file on kallaways github, cause this will really be my first ever contribution in an opensource community. Hoping to continue with this challenge. Also went through jQuery and Bootstrap and tried to refactor the weather app a bit. And was scared of class based react but going through freecode camps react course is kind of encouraging and probably will understand how react worked initally to get better at using the hooks and functional components. Thinking of refactoring the weather app so that it loads correct data initially.

## Day 1: December 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Solved a leetcode problem involving linkedlist in javascript. Read through the basics of SASS. Refactored the weather-app to make a request once initially, instead of making 2.

**Thoughts:** Struggled with the logic of traversing a linkedList had to use leetcode discussion forum. Hope to do away with the discussion forum and come up with original solution. Read through the basics of SASS and learnt that it could do a lot of cool stuff like conditionally style a page, use loops, nest css. Amazing reading!. Came back to the weatherap project modified it to get some simple constant city data and pretty print the JSON which at first seemed like a task, but turns out that can be done with a simple 'pre' tag followed by setting an identation/space in the JSON>stringify() function.

## Day 2: December 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Solved 3 leetcode problems involving arrays. Problems 26,27,28. Tried to implement a debounce function so that search term is only updated after user stops typing.

**Thoughts:** I can now understand the probelm properly and am able to walk through the logic, just the implementation part seems a bit tough. Came up with an original solution which got accepted at the first run. Feels good when the solution gets accepted without failing any test cases. Doing very easy problems currently, but hey baby steps right?. Also thought of implementing SASS in the app but need to work on the main logic first, a search feature which sends request after user stops typing. Well the search for an optimal solution continues but I think I should stop and call it a day.

## Day 4: December 29, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Solved 3 leetcode problems involving binary search. Problems 704,278,35.
**Thoughts:** Read about binary search and iplemented it in the leet code problems. Going through the logic was easy, but managing it different application will need a bit of practice is seems. Hoping to get better.

## Day 5: December 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Solved 2 leetcode problems involving arrays. Problems 977 and 189(using three approaches).
**Thoughts:** The first problem was easy, however trying to come upwith another approach, the second problem was tough, specailly when trying to figure out the other approaches, read through a medium article and managed to get a solution. Almost re-wrote my github repo tracking my progress, created multiple branches and recovered from the fault thanks to stackoverflow.

## Day 6: December 31, 2021

**Today's Progress**: New Years Eve. Solved 2 leetcode problems on arrays. Made a few changes to the weather app.
**Thoughts:** Logic building has improved at a slow pace, but will be there, able to come up with brute force solutions, hopefully will reach the optimized solutions soon. Added google fonts to the weather app, removed the pretty json function, instead passed the data to another component, which is selectively rendering data. Will make it into a beautiful weather app soon. Also happy new year eveyone, lets keep our resolve and continue with this.

## Day 7: January 01, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Solved 2 leetcode problems with two pointer approach and set up the weatherapp on a different machine.
**Thoughts:** Application of two pointer approach has imporved. Had to setup the repos on a different machine, had to read through the documentation of git. Single remote repo is now being run on multiple local repos.

## Day 8: January 02, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Solved 2 leetcode problems with two pointer approach and the daily january challenge.
**Thoughts:** Wanted to use icons in the openweatherapi, read through but not able to get the image. Will read more on the documnet. Leetcode problems have helped me a lot to think systematically and approach a problem.

## Day 9: January 03, 2022

**Today's Progress**:Just solved the daily leetcode problem today.
**Thoughts:** Understood the problem and was able to come up with the logic. Coding the logic was also fairly easy. Wanted to do more but long day it seems.

## Day 10: January 04, 2022

**Today's Progress**:Just solved the daily leetcode problem today, with two approaches.
**Thoughts:** The first approach was easy to use as well as implement, used a lot of built in functions. For the second approach had to visit the very basics of bitwise operators and their uses. All in all quite productive.

## Day 11: January 05, 2022

**Today's Progress**:Read about dynamic programming and backtracking.
**Thoughts:** Came across a probelm on leetcode daily challenge, turns out that it needs to use either DP or BackTracking, so read through the same, planning to solve small problems on them and revisit todays problem later.

**Link to work:** nothing for today

## Day 12: January 06, 2022

**Today's Progress**:Solved a leetcode daily problem, gave a clean look to the weather app.
**Thoughts:** Solved leetcode daily problem. Passed class through props, turns out if one wants to assign class to a react component, they must use props. Gave a clean look to the weather app.

## Day 13: January 07, 2022

**Today's Progress**:Solved a leetcode daily problem, gave a clean look to the weather appm added some styling and displayed the icon.
**Thoughts:** Solved the daily leetcode problem involving linked lists, made some cosmetic changes to the weather app, was able to display the icons provided by openweather api.

## Day 14: January 08, 2022

**Today's Progress**:Solved a leetcode daily problem, read more about dynamic programming. Weather app looks more or less like a complete app.
**Thoughts:** Solved a leetcode daily problem read more about sliding window techinques. Almost completed the weather app with a transparent background for the card component and getting images from unsplash. Hoping to finish the app by tomorrow.
