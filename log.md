# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: December 25, 2021

### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Started with the journey, solved the valid paranthesis probelm on leetcode (problem no.20). Also learnt a bit about forking and working with Git. Revised bootstrap and jQuery.

**Thoughts:** Really struggled with the basic logic of using stacks in javascript but managed to get a solution with time and space complexity of O(n). Feels good to when leetcode accepts your solution. Adjusted the document according to the linters wishes. Hopefully i do not end up overwriting the original file on kallaways github, cause this will really be my first ever contribution in an opensource community. Hoping to continue with this challenge. Also went through jQuery and Bootstrap and tried to refactor the weather app a bit. And was scared of class based react but going through freecode camps react course is kind of encouraging and probably will understand how react worked initally to get better at using the hooks and functional components. Thinking of refactoring the weather app so that it loads correct data initially.
